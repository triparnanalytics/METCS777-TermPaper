Each year thousands of financial institutions report data about mortgages to the public, under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). We provide the data collected under HMDA for 2016.
For mortgage applications, the data will tell you if the consumer got the mortgage—look for applications that were "originated“—or if the consumer was denied, didn't complete the application, or something else happened. The data also have information about pre-approvals and loans sold from one institution to another. For each record, you can learn about the loan, the property characteristics, the applicant demographics, and the lender. The data are modified to protect applicant and borrower privacy.
The descriptions for the dataset attributes are attached in the Dataset_attribute pdf file.
