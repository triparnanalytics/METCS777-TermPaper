# METCS777-TermPaper
This repository contains the full implementation and experiments for our METCS777 Big Data Analytics term paper. We evaluate how Apache Sparkâ€™s RDDs and DataFrames perform across AWS and Google Cloud using large datasets. The study compares processing time, memory use, and cost to identify the most efficient and scalable setup.
