# METCS777-TermPaper
This repository contains the full implementation and experiments for our METCS777 Big Data Analytics term paper. We evaluate how Apache Sparkâ€™s RDDs and DataFrames perform across AWS and Google Cloud using large datasets. The study compares processing time, memory use, and cost to identify the most efficient and scalable setup.

## Project Overview:

**Project Title**: Big Data Performance Evaluation of RDD vs Dataframe on Cloud Platforms  
**By**: Steveen Vargas and Triparna Kundu 
**Project Purpose:**: Compare Spark RDDs vs. DataFrames on AWS and Google Cloud.
**Motivation**: Performance, memory, and cost vary across platforms and data types.
**Method**: Test large datasets; measure time, memory, cost.
**Outcome:** Find the most efficient, scalable, and cost-effective configuration.

## Dataset Information: Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) Dataset
- Published annually by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Contains detailed information on mortgage applications and outcomes.
Includes data on:
- Consumer details and applicant demographics
- Loan amount and property characteristics
- Lender information and loan decision (approved, denied, or incomplete)
- Used to analyze lending patterns and promote fair housing practices.

## Dataset Sample
**hmda_2016_sample.csv** - This is the sample dataset that was initially used in our local system to test the model.
**hmda_2016_nationwide_all-records_labels.csv** - This is the large dataset that is used to compute and compare our model performance on cloud platforms.

## Files Description
This repository contains code separate code versions that run on AWS and Google Cloud. 

**Dataframes:** 
- df_aws.py: Contains the code to run the sample data in AWS EMR
- df_gcp.py: Contains code to run the sample data in Google Cloud

**RDDS**
- rdd_aws.py: Conttains code to run the sample data in AWS
- rdd_gcp_implement.py: Contains code to run sammple data in Google Cloud

## Instruction Examples: 
**For AWS Data Frames:** We fullfill the arguments with the proper file directory structure.
